    <h3>Google Core Web Vital</h3>
    <p>2021 marks another very big change for Google's ranking algorithms and of course, as far as SEO goes, 
        it means good news for some and bad news for a lot of webites and products.</p>
    <p>First, you have to truly understand what people want when they use the search tools, not what they type in the search box, but what they "desire"
        to see as the result. And second, what results should come first, or in other words, "who" among the many relatively similar sources, has the right answer.

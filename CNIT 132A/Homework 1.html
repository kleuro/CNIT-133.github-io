    <pre class="h3">
 A quality website is a website with a fast page load. 
Readers don't like to wait, and it's also no secret that 
  page loading time is playing a very important role 
      in the way how Google is ranking websites.
 And when it comes to page loading time, image size and 
    image optimization are very important factors.</pre>

    <h2>Image wrap-up tools</h2>
    <p>An image compressor can reduce the file size of an image in different ways. Depending on the format you are choosing (JPG, PNG, or other), you can chose a compression level. This will affect the image quality as minimally as possible.</p>
    <p>If your image is still too big, you can lower the file size by also lowering the quality of the image.</p>

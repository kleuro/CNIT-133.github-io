    <p>An image compressor can reduce the file size of an image in different ways. Depending on the format you are choosing (JPG, PNG, or other), you can chose a compression level. This will affect the image quality as minimally as possible.</p>
    <p>If your image is still too big, you can lower the file size by also lowering the quality of the image.</p>

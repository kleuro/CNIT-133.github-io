    <h2>"Progressive Web App"</h2>
    <p>When implemented properly as a progressive enhancement, service workers can benefit users who have
        modern browsers that support the API by providing offline support, but won't break anything for those
        using legacy browsers.
    </p>
    <h2>"Service Worker Concepts"</h2>
    <p>A service worker is an event-driven worker registered against an origin and a path. It takes the form of 
        a JavaScript file that can control the web-page/site that it is associated with, intercepting and modifying
        navigation and resource requests, and caching resources in a very granular fashion to give you complete 
        control over how your app behaves in certain situations.
